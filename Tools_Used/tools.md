Tools Used

During the security assessment of the OWASP Juice Shop application, I used a combination of manual testing techniques and supporting security tools. The goal was to simulate real-world attack scenarios and identify practical security weaknesses.

🔹 Burp Suite (Community Edition)

Burp Suite was my primary tool for intercepting and analyzing HTTP/HTTPS traffic.

How I used it:

Intercepted and modified requests/responses

Tested authentication and authorization flows

Performed brute force testing using Intruder

Manipulated parameters to identify IDOR and access control issues

Analyzed cookies, JWT tokens, and session behavior

This tool was heavily used throughout the engagement.

🔹 Google Chrome Developer Tools

I used Chrome DevTools mainly for client-side analysis.

Activities performed:

Inspected DOM to identify DOM-based XSS

Reviewed JavaScript sources and sinks

Monitored network traffic

Checked security headers and cookies

Observed application behavior during testing

This helped in identifying several client-side weaknesses.

🔹 npm audit

To evaluate third-party dependency risks, I ran npm audit.

Purpose:

Detect vulnerable packages

Identify known CVEs in dependencies

Assess supply chain security risks

Findings from this tool contributed to the insecure dependency vulnerability.

🔹 Manual Testing Techniques

Most of the vulnerabilities in this assessment were identified through manual testing rather than relying only on automated tools.

Techniques I performed:

Parameter tampering

Forced browsing

IDOR enumeration

JWT decoding and analysis

CSRF proof-of-concept testing

Input validation testing

Business logic manipulation

Manual testing was critical in uncovering access control and logic flaws.

🔹 Testing Environment

Target Application: OWASP Juice Shop

Testing Approach: Black-box web application testing

Proxy Setup: Browser traffic routed through Burp Suite

Encoding/Decoding: Base64 decoding used for JWT inspection

⚠️ Disclaimer

All testing was performed in a controlled lab environment on the intentionally vulnerable OWASP Juice Shop application for educational and security assessment purposes only.
